    <h2>Development and Technology Background</h2>
    <p>I went to RIT for computer science. My first 10 or so years after college I was a developer. I primarily coded in C, then moved on to Delphi and C#. Eventually I was pulled in to management. Both as a development manager and a product manager. I've been through two successful start ups. Both starting from scratch.</p>

    <h2>Interests and Activities</h2>
    <p>I mostly like outdoor activities. Some favorites are sailing, hiking, biking (road), and mountain biking. I also occasionally do triathlons. For fun, I like seeing live music and going to festivals.</p>

    <h2>Next Steps...</h2>
    <p>I am very excited to become a proficient and well rounded web developer. I think it is important to understand both front end and back end development (or client side / server side). I intend to build a website for naturopathic doctors listing natural and alternative treatments. I will use these skills to either start my own company, or join a similar company.</p>
